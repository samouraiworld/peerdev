# Private vs Public

Visibility control for functions and variables.

**Key Difference:** Solidity uses keywords (`public`, `private`, `internal`, `external`), Gno uses capitalization (Uppercase = public, lowercase = private).

**Important:** "Private" means not callable/exported, NOT secret. All blockchain data is readable on-chain.
