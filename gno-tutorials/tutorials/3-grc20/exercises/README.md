# Exercise

Create your own custom token that could have:
- Custom distribution process during `init`
Example: 10% Owner, 10% / nb_elligible (From a list), 80% Exchangeable against another token or coins (Example: 1 COIN - 1 FOO20)

- Lock tokens from elligible (Airdrop) to avoid early dumping - Time-Locked Vesting mechanism
Example: After initialisation, elligible can transfer their token after 1 week
/!\ This limit should only impact Airdroped token
