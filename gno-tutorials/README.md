## How to launch the Slidev presentations

Each episode folder may contain a `slides.md` file ready for a Slidev presentation.

### Installation
First, make sure you have **Node.js** installed.  
If not, download it here: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)

Then, install Slidev locally:


To run a presentation locally:

```bash
# 1. Install Slidev locally if you don't have it yet
npm create slidev

# 2. Navigate to the episode folder
cd 0-name-of-episode

# 3. Start the Slidev server
npx slidev

# It will open the presentation at http://localhost:3030
```
