# üå≥ `avl.tree` vs `map` in Gno

Why `map` is not suitable for efficient dynamic on-chain storage\
How Gno‚Äôs `avl.Tree` powers an efficient alternative

<!--
Speaker Notes:
Avl tree has been everywhere in gno.
We'll explore how each data structure functions within Gno's realm environment, their advantages, and when to use one over the other.

# Let's say we have a blog

<!--
// show example of storage use case
From episode 2, take same example

Implementation first with maps
Then avl tree

# üó∫Ô∏è Maps in Gno

**In-memory key/value structure**

Entire dataset loaded into memory


// reverify this
```go
var data = make(map[string]string)
data["key"] = "value"
```

<!--
Map is a linear key / value data structure
Straightforward to use and offer quick access times. 

It load its data entirely into memory, leading to scalability issues. 
can lead to out-of-gas errors in large-scale applications.

# üå≤ AVL Trees in Gno
Self-balancing binary search tree

* **Pros:**
  * Efficient memory usage
  * Suitable for large datasets
  * Deterministic and reproducible

* **Cons:**
  * Slightly more complex implementation
  * O(log n) access times

```go
import "gno.land/p/demo/avl"

var tree avl.Tree
tree.Set("key", "value")
value := tree.Get("key")
```

<!--
Speaker Notes:
AVL Trees, provide longer access time but handle large datasets more efficiently by only charging the necessary.
Scalability and determinism, make them preferable in many scenarios.

Avl tree are self-balancing binary search trees, with their both side of the same deep.
That's how they can achieve it

# ‚öñÔ∏è Comparison: Map vs AVL Tree

| Operation   | **Map** (Small Data) | **AVL Tree** (Large Data) |
| ----------- | ---------------- | --------------------- |
| Lookup      | O(1)             | O(log n)              |
| Insert      | O(1)             | O(log n)              |
| Delete      | O(1)             | O(log n)              |
| Scalability | Poor             | Excellent             |

# üß† When to Use What?

* **Use Maps when:**
  * Working with small constant datasets

* **Use AVL Trees when:**
  * Dealing with dynamic datasets
  * Scalability and efficiency are required
