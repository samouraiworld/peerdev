# Emergency Stop

Emergency pause functionality for critical situations.

**Key Difference:** Solidity uses boolean flags with modifiers, Gno uses boolean state with explicit checks.

## Testing

Run from the tutorial root directory:
```bash
# Test Gno version
./test-snippets.sh 8 gno

# Test Solidity version
./test-snippets.sh 8 sol
```
